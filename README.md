# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant custom sensor for monitoring regular garbage collection schedule. The sensor can be configured for number of different schedules:
- `weekly` schedule (including multiple collection days, e.g. on Tuesday and Thursday)
- `every-n-weeks` repeats every `period` of weeks, starting from the week number `first_week`. It uses the week number - it therefore restarts each year, as the week numbers start again from 1.
- bi-weekly in `even-weeks` or `odd-weeks` (technically, it is the same as every 2 weeks with 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> `first_week`)
- `every-n-days` (repeats regularly from the given first date). If n is multiply of 7, it works similar to `every-n-weeks`, with the difference that it does not use the week numbers (that restart each year) but continues infinitely from the initial date.
- `monthly` schedule (n<sup>th</sup> weekday each month), or a specific weekday of each n<sup>th</sup> week. Using the `period` it could also be every 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> etc month.
- `annually` (e.g. birthdays). This is once per year. Using include dates you can add additional dates manually.
You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection), by configuring the first and last month. 
And you can `group` entities, which will merge multiple schedules into one sensor.

These are some examples using this sensor. The Lovelace config examples are included below.

## Installation

### MANUAL INSTALLATION
1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bruxy70/garbage_collection/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/garbage_collection` directory
   into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant
   installation.
3. Configure the `garbage_collection` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### INSTALLATION VIA Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)
1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Search for and install the "Garbage Collection" integration.
3. Configure the `garbage_collection` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
__Based on the [Home Assistant design guideline](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/04/14/the-future-of-yaml/#the-future-of-yaml), the YAML configuration option will be removed in the future.__

There are 2 ways to configure the integration:
1. Using *Config Flow*: in `Configuration/Integrations` click on the `+` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the sensor (preferred). If you configure Garbage Collection using Config Flow, you can change the entity_name, name and change the sensor parameters from the Integrations configuration. The changes are instant and do not require HA restart.
2. Using *YAML* (deprecated): add `garbage_collection` integration in your `configuration.yaml` and add individual sensors. 
<details>
  <summary>YAML configuration example:</summary>
  
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: "Regular waste" # Each week on Monday and Wednesday. No collection on Christmas, added extra collection on the 27th
    frequency: "weekly"
    collection_days:
    - mon
    - wed
    expire_after: '12:00'
    exclude_dates:
    - '2019-12-25'
    include_dates:
    - '2019-12-27'
  - name: "Bio-waste" # Bi-weekly (odd weeks) on Thursday. Between March and November
    frequency: "odd-weeks"
    first_month: "mar"
    last_month: "nov"
    collection_days: "thu"
  - name: "Large waste summer" # First and third Saturday each month
    frequency: "monthly"
    collection_days: "sat"
    weekday_order_number: 
    - 1
    - 3
    first_month: "may"
    last_month: "oct"
  - name: "Large waste winter" # First Saturday each month only
    frequency: "monthly"
    collection_days: "sat"
    weekday_order_number: 
    - 1
    first_month: "nov"
    last_month: "apr"
  - name: "Large waste" # Combination of winter and summer sensors
    frequency: "group"
    entities:
    - sensor.large_waste_summer
    - sensor.large_waste_winter
  - name: Paper # Every 4 weeks on Tuesday, starting on 4th week each year
    frequency: "every-n-weeks"
    collection_days: "tue"
    period: 4
    first_week: 4
  - name: "Someone's Birthday" 
    frequency: "annual"
    date: '11/24'
```
  
</details>
Entity_id change is not possible using the YAML configuration. Changing other parameters require restarting Home Assistant.

| `expire_after` | No | Time in format format `HH:MM`. If the collection is due today, start looking for the next occurrence after this time (i.e. if the weekly collection is in the morning, change the state from 'today' to next week in the afternoon)
| `verbose_state` | No | The sensor state will show collection date and remaining days, instead of number **Default**: `False`
| `verbose_format` | No | (relevant when `verbose_state` is `True`). Verbose status formatting string. Can use placeholders `{date}` and `{days}` to show the date of next collection and remaining days. **Default**: `'on {date}, in {days} days'`</br>*When the collection is today or tomorrow, it will show `Today` or `Tomorrow`*</br>*(currently in English, French, Czech and Italian).*
| `date_format` | No | In the `verbose_format`, you can configure the format of date (using [strftime](http://strftime.org/) format)  **Default**: `'%d-%b-%Y'`


#### PARAMETERS FOR ALL FREQUENCIES EXCEPT ANNUAL AND GROUP
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
| `first_month` | No | Month three letter abbreviation, e.g. `"jan"`, `"feb"`...<br/>**Default**: `"jan"`
| `last_month` | No | Month three letter abbreviation.<br/>**Default**: `"dec"`
| `exclude_dates` | No | List of dates with no collection (using international date format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`. 
| `include_dates` | No | List of extra collection (using international date format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`.
| `move_country_holidays` | No | Country holidays - the country code (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) for the list of valid country codes).<br/>Automatically move garbage collection on public holidays to the following day.<br/>*Example:* `US` 
| `holiday_in_week_move` | No | Move garbage collection to the following day if a holiday is in week.<br/>**Default**: `false`
| `holiday_move_offset` | No | Move the collection by the number of days (integer -7..7) **Default**: 1
| `holiday_pop_named` | No | Ignore holidays (list of holiday names) *Example:* `"Columbus Day"`, `"Veterans Day"`
| `prov` | No | Country holidays - province (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).
| `state` | No | Country holidays - state (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).
| `observed` | No | Country holidays - observed (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).


#### PARAMETERS FOR ALL FREQUENCIES EXCEPT ANNUAL, EVERY-N-DAYS and GROUP
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
| `collection_days` | Yes | Day three letter abbreviation, list of `"mon"`, `"tue"`, `"wed"`, `"thu"`, `"fri"`, `"sat"`, `"sun"`. 


#### PARAMETERS FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-WEEKS
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`period` | No | Collection every `"period"` weeks (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1
|`first_week` | No | First collection on the `"first_week"` week (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1<br/>*(The week number is using [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) numeric representation of the week)<br/><br/>Note: This parameter cannot be used to set the beginning of the collection period (use the `first_month` parameter for that). The purpose of `first_week` is to simply 'offset' the week number, so that the collection every n weeks does not always trigger on week numbers that are multiply of n. Technically, the value of this parameter shall be less than `period`, otherwise it will give weird results. Also note that the week numbers restart each year. Use `every-n-days` frequency if you need consistent period across the year ends.*


#### PARAMETERS FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-DAYS
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`first_date` | Yes | Repeats every n days from this first date<br>(date in the international ISO format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`).
|`period` | No | Collection every `"period"` days (warning - in this configuration it is days, not weeks!)<br/>**Default**: 1 (daily, which makes no sense I suppose)


#### PARAMETERS FOR MONTHLY COLLECTION
The monthly schedule has two flavors: it can trigger either on the **n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of the weekday** in a month, or on the weekday in the **n<sup>th</sup> week** of each month.

|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`weekday_order_number` | Yes/No | List of week numbers of `collection_day` each month. E.g., if `collection_day` is `"sat"`, 1 will mean 1<sup>st</sup> Saturday each month (integer 1-5)
|`week_order_number` | Yes/No | Similar to `weekday_order_number`, but instead of n<sup>th</sup> weekday of each month, take the weekday of the n<sup>th</sup> week of each month.</br>So if the month starts on Friday, the Wednesday of the 1<sup>st</sup> week would actually be last Wednesday of the previous month and the Wednesday of 2<sup>nd</sup> week will be the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of the month.
|`period` | No | If `period` is not defined (or 1), the schedule will repeat monthly. If `period` is 2, it will be every 2<sup>nd</sup> month. If `period` is 3, it will be once per quarter, and so on.<br/>The `first_month` parameter will then define the starting month. So if the `first_month` is `jan` (or not defined), and `period` is 2, the collection will be in odd months (`jan`, `mar`, `may`, `jul`, `sep` and `nov`). If `first_month` is `feb`, it will be in even months. (integer 1-12)<br/>**Default**: 1

*One of the parameters `weekday_order_number` or `week_order_number` has to be defined. But you cannot combine both options in one sensor.*

#### PARAMETERS FOR ANNUAL COLLECTION
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`date` | Yes | Date of the collection using format `'mm/dd'` (e.g. '11/24' for November 24 each year)

#### PARAMETERS FOR GROUP
|Attribute |Required|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`entities` | Yes | List of `entity_id`s to merge


**IMPORTANT - put include/exclude dates within quotes. Dates without quotes might cause Home Assistant not loading configuration when starting - in case the date is invalid. Validation for dates within quotes works fine.** I think this is general bug, I am addressing that. (See the example above)

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES
### State
The state can be one of

| Value | Meaning
|:------|---------
| 0 | Collection is today
| 1 | Collection is tomorrow
| 2 | Collection is later 

If the `verbose_state` parameter is set, it will show date and remaining days, for example "Today" or "Tomorrow" or "on 10-Sep-2019, in 2 days" (configurable)

### Attributes
| Attribute | Description
|:----------|------------
| `next_date` | The date of next collection
| `days` | Days till the next collection
| `holidays` | List of used country (showing this year)
| `last_collection` | Date and time of the last collection


## Services
### garbage_collection.collect_garbage
If the collection is scheduled for today, mark it completed and look for the next collection.
It will set the `last_collection` attribute to the current date and time.

| Attribute | Description
|:----------|------------
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)

# Lovelace config examples

## Garbage Collection custom card
You can use the custom  [garbage collection card](https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card) developed by @amaximus.

<img src="https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card/blob/master/garbage_collection_lovelace.jpg">


## With images (picture-entity)
This is what I use (I like images). I use a horizontal stack of picture-entities, with `card-templater` plugin ([Lovelace Card Templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater)) to show number of days:

<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/picture-entity.png">

(The `state` is designed to be used like traffic lights, this is why it has 3 values. You obviously cannot use this with `verbose_state`)

This is the configuration
```yaml
      - type: 'custom:card-templater'
        card:
          type: picture-entity
          name_template: >-
            {{ states.sensor.bio.attributes.days }} days
          show_name: True
          show_state: False
          entity: sensor.bio
          state_image:
            "0": "/local/containers/bio_today.png"
            "1": "/local/containers/bio_tomorrow.png"
            "2": "/local/containers/bio_off.png"
        entities:
          - sensor.bio
```

## List view (entities)
The simplest visualization is to use entities. In this case, I use `verbose_state` to show `state` as text.

<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/entities.png">

Integration configuration (you can customize state text by `verbose_format` and `date_format` parameters)
```yaml
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: General Waste
    frequency: 'weekly'
    collection_days: wed
    verbose_state: True
  etc...
```
Lovelace configuration
```yaml
      - type: entities
        entities:
          - sensor.general_waste
          - sensor.bio
          - sensor.paper
          - sensor.plastic
```

## Icon view (glance)
<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/sensor.png">

Integration configuration
```yaml
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: General Waste
    frequency: 'weekly'
    collection_days: wed
    verbose_state: True
    verbose_format: "on {date}, in {days} days"
  etc...
```

Configuration
```yaml
      - type: glance
        entities:
          - sensor.general_waste
```
